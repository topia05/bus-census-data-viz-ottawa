## Visualizations of OC Transpo Data Against Canada Census Data

This project looks at how easy it is to access public transit in different parts of Ottawa and how that relates to things like income and how many people drive. I used OC Transpo bus stop data and 2021 Census data at the neighbourhood (DA) level to explore these patterns. I was especially interested in this topic because I rely on OC Transpo myself—I don’t have a car, so public transit is my main way of getting around.

The full analysis, including interactive maps and plots, is displayed through the link provided.
